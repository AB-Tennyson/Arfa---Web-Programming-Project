[Feb 10, 2025] 
The idea is quite new and I have a lot to think about and improve.
The landing page is just the start and I might change it too based on learning throughout this semester.
My aim is to make this website visually appealing, east and fun to interact with and comfortable to spend time on, encouraging education and making it easy for everyoen.
There is a lot to do, and the landing page for now seems a bit off, but i hope i can pull something better off.
Until next time...
